# üéØ Campaign Feedback System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete campaign feedback collection system that reuses the existing `reviews` table architecture, ensuring seamless integration with your NLP analysis pipeline and aggregation system.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251018_add_campaign_feedback.sql`

- **Extended `reviews` table** to support campaign feedback:
  - Added `provider = 'campaign'` option
  - Added campaign-specific fields: `campaign_id`, `selected_aspects`, `aspect_details`, `ces_score`, `nps_score`
  - Added resolution tracking: `resolution_status`, `resolved_at`
  - Added contact fields: `customer_email`, `customer_phone`
  - Added context metadata for analytics

- **Created `review_campaigns` table**:
  - Campaign metadata (name, status, short_code)
  - Automatic stats tracking (views, ratings, feedback counts)
  - Business relationship and RLS policies

- **RLS Policies**:
  - Users can only manage their own campaigns
  - Public can submit feedback (no auth required)

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `increment_campaign_counter()` for efficient stat updates

---

### 2. Edge Functions

#### a) `submit-campaign-feedback`
**File**: `supabase/functions/submit-campaign-feedback/index.ts`

**Flow**:
1. Validates campaign is active
2. Extracts context metadata (device, time of day, day of week)
3. Inserts feedback into `reviews` table with `provider='campaign'`
4. Triggers NLP analysis automatically (reuses existing `analyze-reviews` function)
5. Increments campaign counters
6. Returns success response

**Handles**:
- Multi-step form data (rating, aspects, CES, NPS, text, contact)
- Automatic NLP processing
- Error handling and validation

#### b) `get-campaign`
**File**: `supabase/functions/get-campaign/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Public endpoint for loading campaign details
- Validates campaign exists and is active
- Returns business info (name, logo, images)
- Increments view counter
- No authentication required

---

### 3. Frontend Components

---

### 4. Data Layer & Services

#### Updated Types
**File**: `src/types/schema.ts`

- Extended `Review` interface with campaign fields
- Added `Campaign` interface
- Updated `ReviewData` for UI components
- Updated transform helpers

#### Data Layer Functions
**File**: `src/lib/dataLayer.ts`

New functions:
- `loadCampaigns(business_id)` - Load all campaigns
- `loadCampaignFeedback(campaign_id, filters)` - Load feedback with filtering
- `updateFeedbackResolution(review_id, status)` - Update resolution status
- `getCriticalFeedbackCount(business_id)` - Get count for badge

#### Campaign Service
**File**: `src/services/api.ts`

New service:
```typescript
campaignService = {
  create(business_id, name)
  getByShortCode(short_code)
  submitFeedback(payload)
  updateStatus(campaign_id, status)
  generateQRCodeURL(short_code)
  getLandingURL(short_code)
}
```

## üîë Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Unified Reviews Table
**Decision**: Use existing `reviews` table for campaign feedback instead of separate table

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ 100% reuse of NLP analysis pipeline
- ‚úÖ Automatic aggregations (aspect insights work for campaign feedback too)
- ‚úÖ Single dashboard can show all feedback sources
- ‚úÖ Less code duplication
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture

### 2. NLP Integration
Campaign feedback automatically triggers the existing `analyze-reviews` function:
- Extracts sentiment, aspects, critical flags
- Generates executive summaries
- Creates action items
- All the same NLP features as public reviews

### 3. Public Landing Page
No authentication required:
- Uses RLS policy allowing `INSERT` when `provider='campaign'`
- Edge functions use service role key for campaign validation
- Clean URLs: `/r/[shortCode]`

---

## üìä How It Works End-to-End

### Creating a Campaign

1. User clicks "Nueva campa√±a" in `/campaigns`
2. Enters campaign name
3. System generates unique 8-char short code
4. Campaign created in database
5. QR code modal appears with download option

### Customer Submits Feedback

1. Customer scans QR or visits link (`/r/abc123`)
2. Loads campaign details via `get-campaign` function
3. Completes multi-step form
4. Submits via `submit-campaign-feedback` function
5. Feedback saved to `reviews` table with `provider='campaign'`
6. NLP analysis triggered automatically
7. Campaign stats incremented
8. Success confirmation shown

### Owner Reviews Feedback

1. Opens `/campaigns`
2. Sees campaign stats and totals
3. Clicks "Feedback" button on campaign
4. Modal opens showing all feedback
5. Can filter by status or critical items
6. Marks items as resolved/ignored
7. Sees critical count badge in navigation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Campaign not loading
- Check `review_campaigns` table has the campaign
- Verify campaign status is 'active'
- Check browser console for errors

### Feedback not submitting
- Verify edge functions are deployed
- Check Supabase function logs
- Ensure RLS policies allow INSERT for provider='campaign'

### NLP analysis not running
- Check if `analyze-reviews` function is deployed
